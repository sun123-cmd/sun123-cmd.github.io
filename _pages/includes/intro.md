Prior to ICT,‚ÄÇI received the B.S. from [HeFei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) (HFUT) in 2023.

My research interest includes Embodied AI methods & computing pipeline, espically for lower computing cost Embodied AI pipeline and real-time Embodied AI contorlling system.
Recently, I'm learning Robust AI for EDA methods, including traditional black box AI for EDA methods and LLM4EDA. 

You can find my CV [here](./files/EngCV.pdf).

I'm always learning on my way, trying to improve myself and eqipping myself with the latest knowledge as the standard of Phd.

In my spare time, I like to climb mountains or go hiking, keeping my mind fresh and clear. A healthy mind and body are the foundation for efficient research.
