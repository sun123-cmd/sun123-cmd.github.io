# üëÄ About Me


I‚Äôm a final year master's student at [Robotics Learning and Chips lab(RLC-Lab)](https://github.com/RLC-Lab) of [Research Center for Intelligent
Computing Systems(CICS)](https://ict.cas.cn/jssgk/zzjg/kyxt/znjsj/js/),  [The Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)](http://www.ict.ac.cn/).

My research interests include **Computer Architecture**, **Embodied AI** and **Robotics**, especially for Embodied AI System Hardware-Software Co-Design. I believe that Embodied AI is a system engineering, which includes fancy algorithms, powerful hardware and real-time robust software. 

I'm always learning on my way, trying to explore, re-search and improve myself, equipping myself with the latest knowledge as the standard of Phd. In my spare time, I like to climb mountains or go hiking, keeping my mind fresh and clear. A healthy mind and body are the foundation for efficient research.

I love my researching, my life and my [bubble](https://panpancui1230.github.io/)‚ù§Ô∏è.
