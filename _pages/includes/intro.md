# üëÄ About Me

I‚Äôm a second year master student at [Robotics Learining and Chips lab(RLC-Lab)](https://github.com/RLC-Lab) of [Research Center for Intelligent
Computing Systems(CICS)](https://ict.cas.cn/jssgk/zzjg/kyxt/znjsj/js/),  [The Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)](http://www.ict.ac.cn/).

Prior to ICT,‚ÄÇI received the B.S. from [HeFei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) (HFUT) in 2023.

My research interest includes Computer Architecture, Real-time Embedding system and Embodied AI, espically for Embodied AI System Hardware-Software Co-Design. I believe that Embodied AI is a system engineering, which including fancy algorithmm, powerful hardware and real-time robust software. 

Recently, I have been analyzing the impact of advanced CPU features on real-time performance, including out-of-order execution, branch prediction, multithreading, and L3 cache. The balance between hardware performance and real-time capability is highly significant for the efficiency of Embodied AI systems.

I'm always learning on my way, trying to explore, re-serach and improve myself, eqipping myself with the latest knowledge as the standard of Phd. In my spare time, I like to climb mountains or go hiking, keeping my mind fresh and clear. A healthy mind and body are the foundation for efficient research.

I love my researching, my life and my [bubble](https://panpancui1230.github.io/)‚ù§Ô∏è.
